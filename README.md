# Qgis_selectbylocation
With this python script, I demonstrated how to perform select by location of mobile towers for a given grid.

First, the script divides a given continent into grids of a chosen shape and size - for this example it was a square shape with 20 by 20 degrees of dimensions. After that, you can select mobile towers that are within each grid and save it into a CSV file.
